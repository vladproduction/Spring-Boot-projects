Steps to create repository:

1)Add to application.properties:
# we do not need to create schemas by hibernate, since we use h2
  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none

2)As soon as we have schema.sql and connection to h2:
making entity from our class 'Room'
@Entity
@Table, etc.

3)Creating Interface RoomRepository which extends from JpaRepository:
parameters are set from Entity class (JpaRepository<Room, Long>)

4)Injecting this Repository into our RoomService:
by creating constructor and passing variable RoomRepository as a parameter:

    private final RoomRepository roomRepository;

    public RoomService(RoomRepository roomRepository) {
        this.roomRepository = roomRepository;
    }

5)Now we are ready to use our repository methods which comes from interface:
roomRepository.findAll()
by executing this we return List<Room> from database;

6)Modifying Controllers (both) by injecting service by creating constructor:
-same procedure as were done for service;
-updating for both @GetMapping requests (we should not use any static data now);

7) endpoints are:
- localhost:8080/rooms   --> for view controller return rooms.html page
- localhost:8080/api/rooms   --> for rest controller return json of existing rooms
